# HyperSocket

Hyper Light and Quick WebSocket wrapper

### Requirements

HyperSocket is used in both [KConk](https://github.com/Kconk-Game) and [Dranik](https://github.com/DranikiRobotics/Dranik),
so it must follow both of their requirements.

If you have any suggestions, please open an issue.
So that I can ~~ignore it~~ take it into account.
